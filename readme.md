> Todo app and some stuff with Express.js

I apologize if i've ignored some rights, but this is done just for learning purposes.
I've cloned this code from it's original author which is written below.
I'm just trying to:
- Learn Node.js ecosystem
- github push/pull/fork
- git workflow
- heroku deployment.

Here is the original readme:


This is an example of classical (no front-end JavaScript frameworks) web application built with Express.js 3.3.5.
